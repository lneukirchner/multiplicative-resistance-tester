# Multiplicative Persistence Tester
Every number has a multiplicative persistence,
which is calculated by first taking the product of every digit in the number multiplied together, then repeating that for the resulting number. 
The number of times this calculation can be repeated before reaching a single digit number is the multiplicative persistence of the original number. 
The current highest multiplicative persistence that has been found is 11. 
The smallest number with this property is 277,777,788,888,899.

# What This Repository Contains
It contains python code which calculates the multiplicative persistence of every number and saves a dictionary of the smallest numbers with each value of multiplicative persistence, up to 9 for the time being.
It also contains the virtual environment to run the code within for best compatibility.
